Barron is using influence of the church to have some additional influence on the town. 

- Was raised by hippies on a commune where none of the locals ever leave
- One day when I was child, a stranger came into town with music and stories
- When he left, I snuck out of the village and followed him to his campsite.
- Begrudgingly, he agreed to take me under his wing. We traveled town to town for years.
- I met other bards through his association, every once in awhile helping them out when the called in a favor
- A fair number of spells have been picked up along the way, very few centered around combat
- One day, a vindictive enchantress cast a spell on him that robbed him of his speech and his music. 
- (Possibly my fault?)
- He passed on his lute to me. He no longer travels, But I make sure to send him letters and a portion of my loot

- Unfortunately, there isn't much loot to send back recently.
- I've been staying in a small town, playing songs, telling tales, and throwing back drinks until I find my next adventure
