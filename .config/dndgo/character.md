Bardic Inspiration
As a bonus action, give an ally a d6 (scales with level) they can add to one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw within the next 10 minutes. You have a number of uses equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1), and regain all uses on a long rest.

---
Song of Rest
Your music during a short rest heals allies and friendly creatures. Health recovered is equal to
- lvl 1: 1d8
- lvl 9: 1d10
- lvl 13: 1d12

---
Mote of Potential
Whenever you give a creature a Bardic Inspiration die, you can utter a note from the Song of Creation to create a Tiny mote of potential, which orbits within 5 feet of that creature. The mote is intangible and invulnerable, and it lasts until the Bardic Inspiration die is lost. The mote looks like a musical note, a star, a flower, or another symbol of art or life that you choose.

- *Ability Check*
  - Party member can roll the Bardic Inspiration die twice and choose which roll to use, as the mote pops and emits colorful, harmless sparks for a moment.

- *Attack Roll*
  - The target and each creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or take thunder damage equal to the number rolled on the Bardic Inspiration die.

- *Saving Throw*
  - Party member gains temporary hit points equal to the number rolled on the Bardic Inspiration die plus your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 temporary hit point).

---
Performance of Creation
Channel the magic of the Song of Creation to create one nonmagical item of your choice in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you. The item must appear on a surface or in a liquid that can support it. The gp value of the item can't be more than 20 times your bard level, and the item must be Medium or smaller. The item glimmers softly, and a creature can faintly hear music when touching it. The created item disappears after a number of hours equal to your proficiency bonus.
